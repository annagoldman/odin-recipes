    <strong>This chocolate-covered matzo has a layer of caramel, which makes it a great choice for Passover dessert. Plus, this recipe is a delicious way to use up any leftover matzos!</strong>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>olive oil cooking spray</li>
        <li>4 unsalted matzo boards, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 cup light brown sugar, firmly packed</li>
        <li>Â¾ cup chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).        </li>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray; arrange matzo boards to fit in a single layer, breaking if necessary.</li>
        <li>Combine butter and brown sugar together in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil, stirring constantly, then boil for about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour butter mixture evenly over matzo on the prepared baking sheet. Transfer baking sheet into the preheated oven and immediately reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C); bake for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) if the matzo are smoking too much.</li>
        <li>Remove baking sheet from oven and sprinkle matzo with chocolate chips. Let stand to melt chocolate, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spread melted chocolate over matzo; place in refrigerator until chilled and set. Break into pieces when cooled.</li>
        <li>Add sliced almonds or sprinkles after the chocolate melts on the warm matzo, or try using white chocolate chips and drizzle dark chocolate on top.</li>
    </ol>
