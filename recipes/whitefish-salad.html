<h1>Whitefish Salad</h1>
    <strong>Whitefish salads are most often drenched in mayonnaise, masking the distinctive smoky, salty flavor of the fish and covering up the crispy celery and
    onion. </strong>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<u>
    <li>2 (packed) cups flaked smoked whitefish (about 12
        ounces)</li>
    <li>½ small white onion, minced</li>
    <li>1 celery stalk, minced</li>
    <li>2 fresh dill sprigs, minced</li>
    <li>1 lemon, juiced, or more to taste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon mayonnaise, or more to taste</li>
    <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Put 1½ cups of the whitefish into a medium bowl. Finely mince the remaining ½ cup, then gently
        stir it into the flaked fish.</li>
    <li>Add the onion, celery, dill, lemon juice and mayonnaise and stir to combine. Taste it, and adjust as
        you like, with more lemon or mayonnaise. (The lemon really makes this whitefish salad shine.)
        Season to taste with pepper. Whitefish salad keeps, covered and refrigerated, for up to 3 days.</li>
